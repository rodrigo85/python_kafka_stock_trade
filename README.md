# ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Stock Order Matching Engine

This project implements a real-time stock order matching system using Python, Kafka, and Cassandra. The engine processes buy and sell orders, efficiently matching them based on price and quantity. It handles real-time order streams via Kafka, and stores active, completed, and historical data in Cassandra for further analysis.

The project simulates a fully operational order book for stock trading with features to track and log trade matches, ensuring accurate records of completed and historical trades.
